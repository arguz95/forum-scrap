Scraping Edmunds Car Forum

In this assignment you are an analytics consultant to a (i) brand manager, (ii) product manager and (iii) advertising manager. Your job is to give advice/insights to these individuals based on the analysis of social media conversations. The detailed tasks are described below.
Develop a crawler/scraper to fetch messages posted in Edmunds.com discussion forums. The crawler output should be a .csv file with the following columns: date, userid, and message (even though you will only use the messages in your analysis).
Fetch around 5,000 posts about cars from a General topics forum. Do NOT choose a forum dedicated to a particular brand or model. Instead, you can choose the General & Sedans categories and then select, for example, the Entry Level Luxury forum (https://forums.edmunds.com/discussion/2864/general/x/entry-level-luxury-performance- sedans). The idea is to have multiple brands and models being discussed without one of them being the focal point.
